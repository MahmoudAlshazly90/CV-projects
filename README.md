# Computer Vision Project

## Overview

This project focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to solve a specific problem or accomplish a particular task. The project may involve tasks such as image classification, object detection, segmentation, or other forms of visual data analysis.

## Project Goals

- **Problem Definition:** Clearly define the problem the project aims to solve.
- **Data Collection:** Acquire or generate the necessary dataset(s) for training and testing.
- **Model Selection:** Choose and implement the appropriate computer vision models.
- **Evaluation:** Assess model performance using relevant metrics.
- **Deployment:** If applicable, deploy the model for real-time or batch processing.

## Features

- **Preprocessing:** Techniques used to preprocess images, such as resizing, normalization, augmentation, etc.
- **Model Architecture:** Description of the model architecture (e.g., CNN, ResNet, YOLO, etc.).
- **Training:** Details on how the model was trained, including hyperparameters, loss function, and optimization algorithms.
- **Evaluation:** Explanation of evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, IoU) and the results obtained.
- **Inference:** How the model is used for making predictions on new data.

## Dataset

- **Source:** Where the dataset was obtained (e.g., Kaggle, custom dataset).
- **Description:** Brief description of the dataset, including the number of images, classes, and any relevant statistics.
- **Preprocessing:** Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for model training.
